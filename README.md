# Snack-or-Booze

Snack-or-Booze is a project completed for Springboard's Software Engineering coding bootcamp. 

Snack-or-Booze was written using JavaScript and React. It is a single-page web application that features a fake restaurant's menu items. A Node library, json-server was used, which creates a fully-featured JSON REST API from a JSON file. It includes the ability to update the JSON file when changes are made via RESTful routing. A user has the ability to add an item to the snack or drink menu, which gets updated in the JSON file.

The application includes error handling and responds with a 404 page when a user visits a page that is not found.

## Installation

Run npm i to install the dependencies and npm start to start the server.

```bash
npm i
```

```bash
npm start
```
